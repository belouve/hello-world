# hello-world
First repo to please both Gods and Daemons

By Daemons, I mean the one and only Daemon, from our DarkNet.

I'm starting up this GitHub account to be added to DC DarkNet to help out for DEFCON 24.

The theme for DEFCON 24 is "Rise of the Machines", and the number 24.

I hope my GitHub knowledge grows, and that I can help DC DarkNet even more.
